            <b>A take-away classic that's so quick and easy to hop from wok to plate at home, you're guaranteed to save yourself a trip to the delivery menu. 
            This is our vegan broccoli stir-fry with "beef" seitan. </b>
            <br><br>
            The broccoli is divided into individual florets and cut into bite-sized pieces, because even as big broccoli admirers, we don't exactly want to chew on a whole tree. 
            The vegetables now come with something in the pan, is steamed briefly with the lid closed and then quenched under running cold water, so the intense green color is retained.
            <br><br>
            The seitan and onion are now sautéed together, stirring frequently, until the seitan becomes slightly crispy here and there and the onion begins to caramelize.
            <br>
            At this point, the well-drained broccoli comes back into play and may now also enjoy some direct heat and brown a bit. 
            I have never understood the principle of distinguished paleness. Especially not when cooking.
