            <b>Extra-creamy, milder compared to the red and green Thai curry and in a maximum of half an hour it is already on the table. 
            This is our vegan yellow Thai curry with vegan "chicken". Could be your new go-to curry, I have a feeling.</b>
            <br><br>
            While probably every curry fan can imagine that the red Thai curry or the spice paste has its color 
            from the red chili peppers and it is only obvious that it is the green chilies in the green variant that the vegetables finally swim in a discreet green, 
            fresh-looking sauce, curry fans in particular, who are somewhat more sensitive to spiciness, now have a lot of respect for a possibly even spicier sauce after eating red 
            ("Yes, I thought it would be spicy based on the color") and green ("Holy shit, that's even spicier! ") now respect a possibly even more lasting impression of yellow. Burns twice and all that.
            <br><br>
            If you belong to the described group, I can reassure you. Our yellow Thai curry is milder with lots of coconut milk and warm spices, gets its intense yellow color from turmeric 
            and thus also means well with "you". But even chili freaks, as we are, should not close the browser window right now. On the one hand, there is still at least a spicy amount of hot peppers 
            in the pot, and on the other hand, you can still have your pear smoked individually at the table - freshly chopped chilies, our chili vinegar or of course Sriracha may never be 
            missing at the spicy-inclusive table. Besides, it just tastes incredibly good even with less steam and between us - and let's put the chili giver aside, if we're honest, it has a bit of 
            tuning Golf with underbody lighting - that's what matters in the end.
